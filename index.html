      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        <p>I'm Zac, an Advanced computing and commerce student majoring in Computer Science and Business Analytics. My passion for problem solving and technology has led my to my degree double degree at The University of Sydney.</p>

        <p>Currently in my academic career, I've been lucky enough to learn programming languages such as Python, java, C++, Assembly x86, HTML, CSS and javascript. Using these languages as a medium to solve computational problems both in teams and individually has driven my love for my current bachelors degree in computer science and business anlytics.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond my academic career, I've pursued personal projects to expand my knowledge in different areas of the computing and analytics world, which can be found under the 'Projects' page. Besides computing, I enjoy playing/watching basketball, walking my dogs and many more hobbies/interests that I'd be happy to discuss with you!</p>
        
        <p>Thanks for checking out my portfolio website, and feel free to reach out via my email or LinkedIn through the contacts page.</p>
