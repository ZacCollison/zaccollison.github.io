        <h2> Coding Fest 2023 AWS DeepRacer First Prize</h2>
        <p>
            I would like to thank the AWS team for hosting the DeepRacer event at USYD Coding Fest 2023 and providing me with the opportunity to
            develop my machine learning knowledge and practice applying it to the development of our cart. My teammate and I learnt
            about multiple machine learning concepts such as epochs, learning rate, entropy and many other hyper parametres required in 
            to deploy our reward algorithm optimally for the race. I am grateful to AWS and my teammate for giving me the opportunity to learn about machine learning and apply it to a race car.
